# Agents Service

This is the repository for my agents service application.

The application is a web application that hosts indirect reciprocity agents mind and allows an environment to create new instances of agents minds. Assigning an agent with a strategy. The environment can query the agent to get an action for an interaction and also update the agents memory of events.

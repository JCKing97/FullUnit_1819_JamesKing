        <p>
            A match consists of two players interacting with each other over a number of rounds.
            Each round a player may choose to cooperate or defect, the choice of what the player does depends on their selected strategy.
            In a nature engine match you may select a strategy for each player and run the match.
            Select a strategy for each of the players and press run to initiate a match, once finished you will be redirected to a page with the outcome and statistics produced by the match.
            If you're unsure of any strategies have a look at the descriptions in the information panel at the bottom.

What I need from analysis:

- Summary of population in each generation
  - Get a (pie?) chart?
- Success measure of each strategy/agent
- Cooperation measure off each agent and generation
- Social ability measure of each agent/strategy and generation
- Idleness measure of each agent/strtaegy and generation
- Success to idleness/gossip ratio of each agent/strategy and generation
- Fitness of each agent

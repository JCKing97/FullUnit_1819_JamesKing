# Prolog Service Proof

This is the repository for a proof of concept application for the Prolog service of my third year project.

Hopefully it will prove that I am able to create a basic web service using Prolog.

To do this I will be follow Anne Ogborn's tutorials from here: http://www.pathwayslms.com/swipltuts/html/index.html

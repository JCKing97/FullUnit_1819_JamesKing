# Prolog Service Proof

This is the repository for a proof of concept application for the Prolog service of my third year project.

Hopefully it will prove that I am able to create a basic web service using Prolog.

To do this I will be following this website http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section(%27packages/http.html%27), this website http://www.swi-prolog.org/howto/http/ and Anne Ogborn's tutorials http://www.pathwayslms.com/swipltuts/html/index.html

I will not be skipping sections of these tutorials focusing on HTML generation even though I will be serving JSON or XML to create my API as these sections are useful to practice this work.

        <p>
            A tournament consists of a number of agents (more than 2) that are all interacting with each other.
            Each agent in the tournament interacts with every other agent in a game between the two.
            Agents accumulate points across the games they play against all the others.
            In a nature engine game you may select a number of agents and assign each agent a strategy, press run to initiate the tournament.
            If you're unsure of any strategies have a look at the descriptions in the information panel at the bottom.
